Hello,I am Qian Jiang,a sophomore computer science undergraduate student at Northeastern University.
(These pages are available on the **https://pbrqianjiang.github.io/**)

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Xiuying Chen](https://iriscxy.github.io/) of NLP Lab from [mbzuai University](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/).I am honored to be advised by [Miao Fang](https://jsjytx.neuq.edu.cn/info/1041/1634.htm) of [Language & Intelligence Systems Lab](https://neuqnlp.github.io/) from [Northeastern University](https://www.neuq.edu.cn/)

In addition, I am lucky to serve as the student leader of [NEUQ LIS Lab](https://neuqnlp.github.io/) in 2025-2026, responsible for the operation and recruitment of new members of the lab,a place staffed by undergraduates.

> I am currently actively seeking for Online or offline research internships or future PhD opportunities. If you have any relevant opportunities or suggestions, please feel free to [contact me](202316187@stu.neu.edu.cn).I am very excited to discuss potential collaborations.

Research Interesting
======
-**Trustworthy AI**ï¼šMy research interests are security and interpretability in the field of trustworthy AI (intersecting with various modalities) , multimodality,other field in deep learning.

-**Diffusion & RL(future)**:I am currently researching safe alignment based on the properties of diffusion, and am curious about the impact of using RLVR and SFT
